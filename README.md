Canvas Boilerplate is the go-to solution for quickly creating modern canvas pieces using ES6 and webpack.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/christopher4lis/canvas-boilerplate.git

2.  Install dependencies:

        yarn

    or

        npm install

3.  Run webpack:

        npm start

Your canvas piece should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000 and you should see 'HTML CANVAS BOILERPLATE' on hover.

:bulb: Concept: The idea behind this mini project is to be able to build a small 2d game that enables your character to navigate on a platform, jump obstacles, avoid death piths which will eventually lead you to a loss.
