Canvas Boilerplate is the go-to solution for quickly creating modern canvas pieces using ES6 and webpack.

## Getting Started

 Install dependencies:

        yarn

    or

        npm install

 Run webpack:

        npm start

Your canvas piece should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000 and you should see 'HTML CANVAS BOILERPLATE' on hover.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Note: This mini project is only for academic purposes. It will never be subject of comercialization.

:book: Story: I was looking for some nice web design videos, until I've found Chris. His youtube channel is full of useful tutorials.

:bulb: Concept: The idea behind this mini project is to be able to build a small 2d game that enables your character to navigate on a platform, jump obstacles, avoid death piths which will eventually lead you to a loss.

# My version

I've tried not to use the sprites that was used in the tutorial. Instead I've used another one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The initial position of where the player is positioned.
The player should be able to stay on top of the platform :white_check_mark:
The background should be able to scroll when the player goes to the right side or left side :white_check_mark:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The jumping functionality of the player:

The player should be able to jump while implementing concepts of gravity and velocity :white_check_mark:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adding death piths to the game that reinitializes the game :white_check_mark:
Here I've tried to add an alert instead of a console log that way it's more visible to the player :v:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, the game should be able to display a win message when you reach the end of the final platform :white_check_mark:

# What I've learned :gem:

-       new concepts like gravity, velocity, accelration, element positioning, setting up the 2 context
-       POO concepts implementation in javascript such as classes, objects, constructors...
-       Event listeners: I was really interested to see how a computer input source can be used to have control over the game, and how it works: converting each input from the keyboard to a code. And how the codes of different keys are called in a switch case to perform a certain action inside the game.
